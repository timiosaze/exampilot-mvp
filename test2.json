    "passage": "To test new ways of using public space, the city launched a three-month pilot called Car-Free Sundays. Each Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., several downtown blocks are closed to private cars. The goal is to reduce traffic noise and air pollution while encouraging people to walk, cycle, and visit local shops. Some merchants worried that delivery trucks wouldn't reach them and that customers buying large items would stay away. In response, the city created an early-morning delivery window before the closure and offered small grants to help businesses rent cargo bike trailers.\n\nAfter the first four Sundays, preliminary data show foot traffic up 23% and noise complaints down 40% during the closure hours. Average sales rose for most cafes, bookstores, and clothing shops, though appliance stores reported little change. One bus route was detoured around the zone, adding about eight minutes to riders' trips. A survey found families and many seniors appreciated the calmer streets, while some commuters disliked the longer bus ride. Next month, council will vote on whether to extend the pilot for a full year and adjust the route for winter conditions.",

    "passage": "A. The narwhal is an endangered type of whale found in the frigid waters of the Arctic, extending from Canada through the Norwegian waters to Russia. Narwhal means \"corpse whale\", and it has earned its name because of its mottled dark grey colour. Narwhals are regularly harvested for meat and ivory in northern Canada and Greenland. Narwhals share physical characteristics with Beluga whales, having similar shape and size. Both species lack dorsal fins, have short beaks, rounded heads and a thick layer of blubber to adapt to glacial conditions.\n\nB. The narwhals’ distinctive characteristic lies in the presence of a long 2.5 meter spiralling tusk that protrudes from the males' foreheads, resembling a unicorn. The horn-like formation, however, is a long left tooth. The right tooth remains embedded in the skull and measures roughly 30 centimeters. Female tusks have a more regularly defined morphology. They are much shorter, straighter, and do not collect as much algae on the surface, thus appearing whiter.\n\nC. For hundreds of years the purpose of the tusk on the \"unicorn whale\" has puzzled scientists and local aboriginal elders alike. A northern aboriginal legend explains the narwhal's tusk was created when a woman shooting with a harpoon rope was dragged into the ocean after the harpoon had struck a large narwhal whale. She then was transformed into a narwhal herself, and her hair, which was long and twisted, became the characteristic of the spiral tusk. In academic circles, the tusk remains an evolutionary mystery that defies many of the known principles of mammalian teeth. Preliminary studies suggest the tusk enables whales to determine salinity levels and allows them to detect food in their environment.\n\nD. Narwhal behaviour also intrigues researchers. Males frequently engage in episodes of rubbing their tusks together, or “tusking,” for as-yet unknown reasons. The same behaviour is not observed in the female counterparts or between females and males. Some studies theorize about the possibility of these being mating behaviours aimed at displaying genetic superiority. Support for such a theory, however, has proved scarce since unlike other mammalian species the behaviour is not aggressive. Narwhals are a migratory species. In an attempt to learn about their migration patterns and social behavior, their populations are being observed and recorded through satellite tracking conducted by scientists in Canada and Greenland.\n\nE.

      "Visitors walking through Carleton High School are often surprised when they pass Bradley Gordon's French class and see students riding on exercise bikes and sitting on yoga balls. Is it a French class, or is it a gym class? Well, it's a bit of both!",
      "Two major concerns in education are childhood obesity and ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a disorder that results in restlessness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. With high rates of obesity and also students struggling with ADHD in classes across the country, Mr. Gordon came up with an innovative intervention to address both. He decided to infuse academic studies with physical activity in his own classroom.",
      "The idea came to Gordon after a personal experience in university while working on his bachelor's degree. \"I didn't have time to schedule a separate slot for exercise, and my health deteriorated rapidly,\" said Gordon. \"After feeling sick and fatigued for months, I decided to couple my studying with my workouts. To my surprise it proved incredibly helpful. My grades started improving and so did my overall fitness and health.\"",
      "Gordon implemented the approach with his students to great effect last year. Despite the students' excitement and academic improvement, he met resistance from the school's principal, Dawn Epstein, who was not convinced that academics and physical exercise should be amalgamated. \"Although exercise is certainly important, I didn't think it had any place in academics. I assumed exercise would exacerbate ADHD,” Epstein asserted.",
      "It turns out Ms. Epstein’s reaction is a common misconception. As Dr. John Ratney, psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School, explains: “Exercise turns the attention system on, and helps with working memory, prioritizing and sustaining attention.” Sustained physical exertion causes kids to be less impulsive and more prone to learn. That’s precisely what Mr. Gordon found a year into the intervention. “My students’ endurance, both physical and mental, has improved. They are fit, and eager to learn. Even students diagnosed with ADHD have displayed less physical agitation, which has helped them to learn better.” So, when you walk by Mr. Gordon’s class and see bikes spinning, know that minds are at work."
